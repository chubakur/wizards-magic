If you want to play in your own game server, do the following:
  * In folder "server" edit file "WizardsMagic.py". Set variables "host" and "port" to your host ip, and selected port for binding. Run WizardsMagic.py.

  * Now server works. To connect the client to your own server set host and port on options frm main menu.
